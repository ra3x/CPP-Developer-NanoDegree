C++ is a compiled language, which is to say there is a separate program - the compiler - that converts our code to an executable program that the computer can run. This means that, after we save a new C++ program to file, running it is normally a two step process:

1. Compile our code with a compiler. (g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp)
2. Run the executable file that the compiler outputs. (./a.out)
