- Encapsulation and Abstraction are the core properties of object-oriented Programming, ther're also related.
- Encapsulation means that we bundle related properties together in a single class and sometimes we protect those properties from unauthorized or accidental modifications. 
- Abstraction means that users of our class only need to be familiar with the interface we provide. they don't have to know how we actually store member data or implement member functions. 

- Encapsulation and Abstraction are related because encapsulation gruops relevant data together in a class while Abstraction hides the details of how we work with this data.
