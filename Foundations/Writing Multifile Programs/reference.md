# Reference: 

a reference is another name given to an existing variable. On the left hand side of any variable declaration, the `&` operator can be used to declare a reference. 

**Sample Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;
    
    // Declare a reference to i.
    int& j = i;
    cout << "The value of j is: " << j << "\n";
    
    // Change the value of i.
    i = 5;
    cout << "The value of i is changed to: " << i << "\n";
    cout << "The value of j is now: " << j << "\n";
    
    // Change the value of the reference.
    // Since reference is just another name for the variable,
    // th
    j = 7;
    cout << "The value of j is now: " << j << "\n";
    cout << "The value of i is changed to: " << i << "\n";
}
```
